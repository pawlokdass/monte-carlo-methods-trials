# Description - Monte Carlo Simulations in R (trying out JourneyOfAnalytics codes)

```{r}
# Laod library packages:
library(data.table)

# set global options:
options(scipen = 999999)   # we don't want to use scientific notation .
options(digits = 4)   # we want only 2 digits after the decimal.

```
# Basic Monte Carlo code: 
```{r}
runs <- 100000
sims <- rnorm(runs,mean=4,sd=10)
mcmc_val <- sum(sims >= 3 & sims <= 6)/runs
cat(mcmc_val,'\n')
```

# For a given group of 8th grade male students, the average weight
# is 160 pounds and the standard deviation is 5.5 pounds. What is the probability
# that a student weighs over 205 pounds if we were to sample 5000 similar students?
```{r}
runs <- 5000
sims <- rnorm(runs,mean=160,sd=5.5)
mcmc_val <- sum(sims >= 205)/runs
cat(mcmc_val)
```
# Probability for weight of student >= 165 pounds.
```{r}
runs <- 5000
sims <- rnorm(runs,mean=160,sd=5.5)
mcmc_val <- sum(sims >= 165)/runs
cat(mcmc_val)
```
